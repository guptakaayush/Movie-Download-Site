                With a budget of 410 crores, Brahmastra Part One: Shiva sparked unprecedented hype following its release. While it wasn't the highest-grossing picture of the year, it was one of the most expensive Indian films ever made, trailing only RRR and Robo 2.0. Brahmastra had its international premiere in September 2022, grossing $28 million over its global weekend, but Ayan Mukerji had already planned a trilogy as part of the Astraverse.<br>
                <br>
                The film stars a stellar ensemble that includes Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Deepika Padukone, and Millennium star Amitabh Bachchan. Despite not achieving the desired earnings at the box office, Ayan Mukerji is optimistic about the trilogy's planned sequels. Brahmastra Part One: Shiva, featuring plenty of the best moments, closed on a high note, leaving certain loose ends to be resolved in the succeeding films.<br>
                <br>
                While seeking answers in the upcoming films seems thrilling, the finale left spectators perplexed with various unsolved portions. So, here's a concise explanation of everything that unfolded at the end of Brahmastra Part One: Shiva.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Brahmastra Part One: Shiva: What Happened in the Film?</h2>

            <p>
                While jumping right to the ending may sound appealing, having a thorough film recap may help viewers comprehend it better. The film began with an excellent narration by Amitabh Bachchan, who explained Hindu Mythology and the origin of Astras, which the Secret Society of Sages guarded. Junoon and her group obtained Vanarastra from Shah Rukh Khan's Mohan Bhargav after a thorough hunt for Astras. However, when they decided on Anish Shetty as their next target, Shiva, the film's protagonist, intervened and put their plans on hold.<br>
                <br>
                Anish Shetty sacrifices himself to save Shiva after discovering he has been experiencing visions about Brahmastra. Shiva eventually arrives at the Secret Society's Ashram and is greeted by Amitabh Bachchan's Guru, who wields Prabhastra. However, Junoon survives Anish Shetty's attack and controls a village full of people to locate the Secret Society. When Shiva comes into contact with Junoon's Kavachastra fragment, she discovers the location and launches a surprise attack.<br>
                <br>
                After a period of fierce battles, the story comes to a climax in which Junoon, despite falling over a cliff, survives and returns to reassemble Brahmastra, therefore triggering widespread destruction. Shiva, with pure resolve, brings forth the true power of Agneyastra and confronts the might of Brahmastra, saving the world from annihilation. Unfortunately, it also posed another massive issue, leaving us hanging and wanting more.<br>

            <h2>Brahmastra Ending Explained: Dev, Amrita, and Mystery Behind Shiva's True Power</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                When Junoon gathers all the pieces of Brahmastra, everyone believes the world is about to end. However, something unexpected happens as Shiva awakens, unleashing formerly unseen ability and halting the destruction. "The light of Brahmastra was controlled by Shiva's Fire," Guru says. Shiva resolves to sacrifice himself to protect Isha after knowing they are both going to perish. This unselfish decision led to the emergence of his new power, and Shiva has been looking for light in his life since the beginning of the film, and it just so happens to be Isha.<br>
                <br>
                Guru also narrates the battle that took place on the sunken island while delving into Shiva's past. It turns out that Amrita and Dev are Shiva's parents, and Dev is obsessed with possessing all Astras, particularly Brahmastra. Apart from her quick facial introduction, we haven't seen much of Amrita, yet she emerged triumphant in the battle, trapping Dev in a statue on the island and shattering Brahmastra into pieces.<br>
                <br>
                We don't know if Amrita is still alive, but she concealed more than simply Agneyastra inside Shiva. Otherwise, he wouldn't have received all of those visions from the beginning, and it also explains how he could halt Brahmastra with his willpower. As depicted in Shiva's flashback, Amrita may have sacrificed herself anticipating the events and implanted her soul's flame into Shiva's conscience. Hopefully, it will aid him in his imminent clash with Dev in future installments.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Post-Credit Scene Explained: What Triggered Dev's Awakening?</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                Although merging all the pieces of Brahmastra led to the destruction of the world, it also served another purpose from Junoon's perspective, which the Sages of the Secret Society are unconscious of. The film rewinds the scenes during the post-credit sequence to depict what exactly led to the awakening of Dev, the mastermind behind the shadows. It's possible that Dev planned everything from the start when he understood he'd lose to Amrita and bound his life to Brahmastra.<br>
                <br>
                As shown in the flashback scenes, Amrita delivers the shattered fragments of Brahmastra, implying that she knows Dev already possessed and mastered it. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the world would have been destroyed because Dev appears to have a different agenda, and he would not just let that happen after his awakening.<br>
                <br>
                Dev, unlike other characters, mastered a variety of Astras. The post-credit sequence showed Dev holding Agneyastra in his trident, signifying that Shiva did not possess the entire Astra. Dev also bears Kavachastra in his Pauldron, Jalastra in his Bracelet, an Unknown Astra in his Crown, and the Kalmani in the center of his chest, which Junoon uses to brainwash the village residents during the final battle.
                <br>
                Brahmastra Part One: Shiva had several opportunities to transform flaws into positive aspects but ultimately failed. However, Ayan Mukerji is aware of the criticism from experts and audiences. Hopefully, he avoids these in future installments and offers a gold-standard movie for viewers to cherish.<br>
