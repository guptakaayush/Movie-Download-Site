The film began its production in December 2019 but was halted in March 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Pushpa: The Rise was released on 17 December 2021.

The film was commercially successful, grossing ₹350.3–₹373 crore at the box office. The film emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film in 2021, and ranks among the highest-grossing Telugu films of all time.<br>
