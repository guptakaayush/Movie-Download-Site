            <p>
                Ayaan Kapoor is a real estate businessman who is in debt of â‚¹16 crores. He had a growing real estate business, but fell into debt due to his involvement in black money and subsequent demonetisation. He wanted to sell his house to repay his debt but could not find any buyer and starts living at his wife's house with his wife - Inspector Ruhi - and daughter Pihu.<br>
                <br>
                One day, Ayaan gets involved in a road accident, and regains consciousness in Heaven, where the gods Yamaduta and Chitragupta provide him a chance to send him back to Earth by asking him to play a game called Game of Life. There are two containers, one to be filled with white balls, which represent his positives, and the other with black balls, which represent his sins and weaknesses. The initial position for Ayaan is very tough as he starts off with a lot of black balls. Ayaan is shown to be jealous of his wife Ruhi as she's an inspector whereas Ayaan had failed to become an inspector. Chitragupta puts him in a scenario where he's an inspector tasked to save a hostage. However, his failure to do so shows him that the reality is that he couldn't have been a better inspector when compared to Ruhi. Ayaan is shown to be the one who believes in God but he still gets black balls because of his lack of humanity.<br>
                <br>
                Later on, the game changes when Ayaan finally gets white balls for controlling his anger. His challenges also include apologizing his elder sister for falsely blaming her during their childhood of the burning their father's house. In heaven, Ayaan gets beaten by his father due to which he apologizes to his sister. He wins by earning white balls due to which Chitragupta awards him a check of 18 crores for the sale of house, something that even Ayaan couldn't do. However, Chitragupta sees a tattoo of another woman on Ayaan's elbow, earning him many black balls. Chitragupta shows him reality, where his wife and relatives were planning to buy him a new car after hearing that his car would be towed due to his bank loan. But the car which collided with Aayan's car was the new car that Ruhi bought for Ayaan.

                He returns to earth where Doctor tells him that Pihu's kidneys are damaged and Ruhi's one kidney is affected. Aayan earns reputation in real estate but was about to lose his family. Ayaan signed a donor form before becoming unconscious again due to overdose of some pills. Later on, he again returns to heaven where Chitragupta and his father are proud of him. Chitragupta blesses Ayaan and his family with a new life. The Doctors give Ayaan news that a man bought his dead relative's body but didn't reveal his name. However, it's revealed that the man was wearing a locket where it was written CG. After being blessed with new life, Ayaan gets his ancestral home repaired and also adopts a child. This time, he's a changed man who now gives more importance to his family.<br>
